# 📊 Telco Customer Churn Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project presents a comprehensive **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** of a Telco Customer Churn dataset to identify key factors influencing customer attrition.  
Using data visualization and statistical analysis, the project aims to uncover churn patterns and translate them into **actionable business insights** that can help improve customer retention.

## 📂 Dataset Information
- **Total Customers:** 7,043  
- **Total Features:** 21  
- **Target Variable:** Churn (Yes / No)  
- **Data Type:** Customer demographics, services, contracts, billing, and payment behavior  

---

## 🎯 Objective
The primary objectives of this analysis are:
- To understand overall customer churn behavior
- To identify high-risk customer segments
- To analyze the impact of tenure, contracts, services, and payment methods on churn
- To provide data-driven business recommendations

## 🔍 Key Insights

### 📉 Overall Churn
- Approximately **26.5% of customers have churned**
- Around **73.5% of customers are retained**

### 👥 Demographics
- **Gender** has minimal impact on churn
- **Senior citizens exhibit significantly higher churn (~41.7%)** compared to non-senior customers (~23.6%)

### ⏳ Tenure
- Customers with **short tenure** show the highest churn
- Churn decreases significantly as customer tenure increases

### 📄 Contract Type
- **Month-to-month contracts have the highest churn**
- **Two-year contracts show the strongest retention**

## 🏁 Conclusion
This analysis demonstrates that customer churn in the telecom domain is driven primarily by **tenure, contract structure, service adoption, and payment behavior**, rather than basic demographics.  
The insights from this EDA provide a strong foundation for predictive modeling and data-driven retention strategies.
